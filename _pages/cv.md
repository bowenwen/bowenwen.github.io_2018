I started my journey into data science as an engineering researcher at the University of Toronto, where I modeled vehicle travel times using GTFS and GPS data. Then, as a Data Scientist for a Toronto-based international consulting firm, I led several proof-of-concept projects to integrate data science with software products and improve business decisions.

I am currently a Modeler at TransLink. I am the go-to guy for Vancouver's regional travel demand forecasting and I use python, R, git, and EMME to make this happen.

I love working with big data and building models to answer important business questions. I believe in leveraging the power of data to improve people's lives.
