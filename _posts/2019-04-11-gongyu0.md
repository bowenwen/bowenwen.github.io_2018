How can anything be boiled down to just one word? If the Adam I know and the Adam you know are entirely different people, how reliable is the meaning of that name? Something as simple as an apple does not even have consistent meanings. If I say Apple, you might think of the fruit, or the tree that bears the fruit, or the Big Apple city, or maybe the company that makes your iPod. A name is merely a label for a multi-faceted truth we know and conceptualize. It is probably one of the most useful tool we invented, but at the same time, it can be the origin of many misunderstandings.

What is **Gongyu0 公寓〇**? It is apartment in Chinese. For me, it is a symbol for the impermanence of things. It also represents the movement of information and the absence of ownership. The circle of ensō inspires the freedom of the mind.

This is the song that partly inspired the name of this blog:  
等你下课 (Waiting for you after class) by 周杰伦 (Jay Chou)
